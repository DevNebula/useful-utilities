#GitHub Organization Sync Utility
This script will build a full Organization Github clone environment. 
		This was designed for use on a Mac, but Linux with bash should work
		This will only handle organization with less than 400 Repos (Assuming paging limits on GitHub API)
    Build to help sync Github to OpenGrok
    Also useful to keep the complete organization source code pulled and refreshed for development
